       ;; The upshot of this is that invalid basic auth creds are
       ;; accepted (on the first attempt), so if the user makes a
       ;; mistake typing them in, no re-attempts are allowed. It is
       ;; hard for yada to provide re-attempts to a human, because it
       ;; is designed to support other types of user-agent, where
       ;; re-attempt counting would not be desirable.
