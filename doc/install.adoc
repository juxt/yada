[[installation]]
== Installation

[yada]#yada# is a Clojure library and if you are using it directly from a
Clojure application with a Leiningen `project.clj` file, include the
following in the file's *:dependencies* section.

[source,clojure]
----
[yada "1.1.29"]
[aleph "0.4.1"]
[bidi "2.0.8"]

[[setting-up-a-development-environment]]
=== Setting up a development environment

The best way to learn is to experiment with [yada]#yada#, either on its own or
by using it to build some service you have in mind. Either way you'll
want to set up a quick development environment.

[[the-easy-way-clone-edge]]
=== The Easy Way: Clone edge

The quickest and perhaps easiest way to get started is to clone the [yada]#yada#
branch of JUXT's *edge* repository. This is a continuously improving
development environment representing our firm's best advice for building
Clojure projects.

[source,clojure]
----
git clone git@github.com/juxt/edge
----

*edge* is opinionated and combines a number of practices that we've
found useful on many projects at JUXT.

If you're new to Clojure, we recommend learning [yada]#yada# with edge. Not only is it packed full of examples for you to explore, the project can provide a solid foundation for your own projects with an architecture that is proven to scale as your project grows.

[[the-simple-way-construct-your-own]]
=== The Simple Way: Construct your own

If you prefer to build your own development environment you'll need a few pointers in order to integrate with [yada]#yada#.

[[serving-resources]]
==== Serving resources

To serve the resources you define with [yada]#yada# you'll need to choose a port and start a web server. Currently, [yada]#yada# provides its own built-in web server (https://github.com/ztellman/aleph[Aleph]), but in the future other web servers will be supported. (For now, please be reassured that Aleph will support many thousands of concurrent connections. Aleph is built on Netty, a very capable platform used by Google, Apple, Facebook and many others to support extreme workloads.)

To start a web-server, just require `listener` from `yada.yada` and call it with a route structure and some configuration that includes the port number.

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[yada.yada :refer [listener resource as-resource]])

(def svr
  (listener
   ["/"
    [
     ["hello" (as-resource "Hello World!")]
     ["test" (resource {:produces "text/plain"
                        :response "This is a test!"})]
     [true (as-resource nil)]]]
   {:port 3000}))
----

The `listener` function returns a map. To shutdown the listener, call the 0-arity function contained in the `:close` entry.

[source,clojure]
----
((:close svr))
----

[[creating-resources]]
==== Creating resources

Resources can be created in the following ways:

* From a resource model, calling `resource` with a map argument
* Using `as-resource` on an existing type known to [yada]#yada#
* A normal Ring handler

[[routing-to-resources]]
==== Routing to resources

A handler can be created from a resource by [yada]#yada#'s `handler` function, and this handler can be used anywhere a Ring-compatible function is expected. This way, you can use any routing library you wish, including Compojure.

However, [yada]#yada# and bidi _are_ designed to work together, and there are a number of features that are enabled when they are used together. That's why you can put [yada]#yada# resources in a bidi route structure without turning them into handlers, since bidi knows how to do that already.

[[repl-and-testing]]
=== REPL and Testing

The `response-for` function is great for testing the Ring response that would be returned from a [yada]#yada# type or handler.

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[yada.yada :refer [response-for]])

(response-for "Hello World!")
----
