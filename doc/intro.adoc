== Introduction

[yada]#yada# is a web library written in Clojure that lets you create websites
and web APIs.

Design goals:

- Be easy of use for intermediate Clojure developers
- Comprehensive compliance with HTTP standards over pragmatism and performance
- Increase productivity through re-use
- Handle large workloads with reasonable performance
- Support multiple architectural styles, including Hypermedia APIs (REST)

[yada]#yada# is sufficiently quick-and-easy for quick prototype work but scales up
when you need it to, to feature-rich secure services that can handle the
most demanding workloads, while remaining faithful to the HTTP
standards.

=== Say 'Hello!' to yada!

It's quick to get started with [yada]#yada# without knowing how it works - it's easy to get started even if you only have a basic knowledge of Clojure.

Let's begin with a few examples. The obligatory *Hello World!* example is link:intro-examples/hello[`(yada/handler "Hello World!")`], which responds with a message.

Perhaps you might want to serve a file? That's
link:intro-examples/index.html[`(yada/handler (new java.io.File "index.html"))`].

Now you know how to serve a file, you know how to link:intro-examples/dir/[serve a directory]. But perhaps you've got some resources on the classpath?
`(yada/handler (clojure.java.io/resource
"talks/"))`.

What about link:intro-examples/nil[`(yada/handler nil)`]? Without knowing, can you guess what that might do? (That's right, it produces a `404 Not Found` response).

What about a quick dice generator? link:intro-examples/dice[`(yada/handler #(inc (rand-int 6)))`].
Notice we use a function here, rather than a constant value, to vary numbers between rolls.

How about streaming those dice rolls as 'Server Sent Events'? Put those
link:intro-examples/sse-dice[dice rolls on a core.async channel], and return it with [yada]#yada#.

All these examples demonstrate the use of Clojure types that are
converted on-the-fly into [yada]#yada# resources, and you can create your own
types too.

Let's delve a little deeper…

=== Resources

In [yada]#yada#, resources are defined by a plain-old Clojure map.

This has many benefits. While functions are opaque, data is open to
inspection. Data structures are easy to generate, transform and query -
chores that Clojure makes light work of.

Here's an example of a resource:

[source,clojure]
----
(yada/resource
  {:properties {…}
   :methods {:get {:response (fn [ctx] "Hello World!")}
             :put {…}
             :brew {…}}
 …
})
----

There's a lot of things you can do with a resource data model but perhaps the most obvious is to create a request handler from it to create responses from HTTP requests. That's the role of a **handler**.

With [yada]#yada#, we transform a resource into a handler using the `handler` function.

[source,clojure]
----
(require '[yada.yada :as yada])

(yada/handler (yada/resource {…}))
----

A handler can be called as a function, with a single argument representing an HTTP **request**. It returns a value representing the corresponding HTTP response. (If you are familiar with Ring, this is the Ring handler, but not one you have to write yourself!)

=== Serving requests

To use [yada]#yada# to create real responses to real HTTP requests, you need to add [yada]#yada# to a web-server, such as Aleph or Immutant. The web server takes care of the networking and messages of HTTP (RFC 7230), while [yada]#yada# focuses on the semantics and content (starting with RFC 7231).

To write real applications, you also need a router that understands URIs, and [yada]#yada# has some features that are enabled when used with bidi, although there is nothing to stop you using [yada]#yada# with other routing libraries.

=== Conclusion

That's [yada]#yada# in a nutshell, but the quickest way to to learn it is to set up an environment and have a play.

The link:{next}[next chapter] explains how to do that.
