[[security]]
== Security

Built-in to the library, yada offers a complete standards-based set of security features for today's secure applications and content delivery.

[[security-is-part-of-the-resource-not-the-route]]
=== Security is part of the resource, not the route

In yada, resources are self-contained and are individually protected from unauthorized access. We agree with the HTTP standards authors when we consider security to be integral to the definition of the resource itself, and not an extra to be bolted on afterwards. Nor should it be complected with routing. The process of identifying up a resource from its URI is independent of how that resource should behave, and shouldn't be coupled to it.

Building security into each resource yields other benefits, such as making it easier to test the resource as a unit in isolation of other resources and the router.

As in all other areas, yada aims for 100% compliance with core HTTP standards when it comes to security, notably https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7235[RFC 7235]. Also, since HTTP APIs are nowadays used to facilitate transactional integration between systems via the user's browser, it is critically important that yada fully supports systems that offer APIs to other applications, across origins, as standardised by http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/[CORS].

[[the-access-control-entry]]
=== The `:access-control` entry

All security aspects for a resource are specified in its model's
`:access-control` entry.

[[authentication]]
=== Authentication

Let's look at authentication first. Authentication is the process of establishing and verifying the identity and credentials of the user, with reasonable confidence that the user is not an impostor.

In yada, authentication happens after any request parameters have been processed, so if necessary they can be used to establish the identity of the user. However, it is important to remember that authentication happens before the resource's properties have been loaded, since credentials do not have to do with the actual resource. Thus, if the user is not genuine, we might well save a wasted trip to the resource's data-store.

In HTTP, resources can exist inside a _protection space_ determined by
one or more __realms__. Each resource declares the realm (or realms) it
is protected by, as part of the *:access-control* entry of its
**resource-model**.

[[authentication-schemes]]
==== Authentication schemes

Each realm declares one or more _authentication schemes_ governing how
requests are authenticated.

yada supports numerous authentication schemes, including custom ones you
can provide yourself.

Each scheme has a verifier. Depending on the scheme this is usually a
function. The verifier is used to extract or otherwise establish the
credentials in the request, ensuring they are authentic and true, in
which case it returns these credentials as a value to be stored in the
request context. These credentials may contain information such as the
user's identity, roles and privileges. If no credentials are found, the
verifier should return nil.

If no credentials are found by any of the schemes, a 401 response is
returned containing a WWW-Authenticate header.

[[basic-authentication]]
==== Basic authentication

Here is an example of a resource which uses Basic authentication
described in https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2617.txt[RFC 2617]

[source,clojure]
----
{:access-control
  {:realm "accounts"
   :scheme "Basic"
   :verify (fn [[user password]] …}}
----

There are 3 entries here. The first specifies the __realm__, which is
defaults to `default` in Basic Authentication, but if specified is
contained in the dialog the browser presents to the user.

The second declares we are using Basic authentication.

The last entry is the verify function. In Basic Authentication, the
verify function takes a single argument which is a vector of two
entries: the username and password.

If the user/password pair correctly identifies an authentic user, your
function should return credentials.

[source,clojure]
----
(fn [[user password]]
  …
  {:email "bob@acme.com"
   :roles #{:admin}})
----

If the password is wrong, you may choose to return either an empty map
or nil. If you return an empty map (a truthy value) and the resource
requires credentials that aren't in the map, a 403 Forbidden response
will be returned. However, if you return nil, this will be treated as no
credentials being sent and a 401 Unauthorized response will be returned.

From a UX perspective there is a difference. If the user-agent is a
browser, returning nil will mean that the password dialog will reappear
for every failed login attempt. If you return truthy, it will show the
403 Forbidden response.

You may choose to limit the number of times a failed 'login' attempt is
tolerated by setting a cookie or other means.

[[cookie-authentication]]
==== Cookie authentication

We can also use cookies to present authentication credentials. The
advantage of cookies is that they can be set by the server based on
custom authentication interaction with the user, such as the submission
of a login-form.

To protect a site with cookies:

[source,clojure]
----
{:access-control
  {:scheme :cookie
   :cookie "session"
   :verify (fn [cookie] …}}
----

[[jwt-authentication]]
==== JWT authentication

[[form-based-logins]]
==== Form-based logins

Basic Authentication has a number of weaknesses, such as the difficulty
of logging out and the lack of control that a website has over the
fields presented to a human. Therefore, the vast majority of websites
prefer to use a custom login form generated in HTML.

You can think of a login form as a resource that lets the user present
one set of credentials in order to acquire additional ones. The
credentials the user presents, via a form, are verified and if they are
true, a cookie is generated that certifies this. This cookie provides
the certification to subsequent requests in which it is sent.

Let's start by building this login resource that will provide a login
form page to browsers and verify the form data when that form is
submitted.

Here's a simplistic but viable resource model for the two methods
involved:

[source,clojure]
----
(require
 '[buddy.sign.jws :as jws]
 '[schema.core :as s]
 '[hiccup.core :refer [html])

{:methods
 {:post
  {:consumes "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
   :parameters {:form
                {:user s/Str :password s/Str}}

   :response
   (fn [ctx]
     (let [{:keys [user password]} (get-in ctx [:parameters :form])]
       (if (valid-user user password)
         (assoc (:response ctx)
                :cookies {"session"
                          {:value
                           (jws/sign {:user user} "lp0fTc2JMtx8")}})
         "Try again!")))}
  :get
  {:produces "text/html"
   :response (html
              [:form
               [:input {:name "user" :type :text}]
               [:input {:name "password" :type :password}]
               [:input {:type :submit}]])}}}
----

The POST method method consumes incoming URL-encoded data (the classic
way a browser sends form data). It de-structures the two parameters
(user and password) from the form parameters.

We then determine if the user and password are valid (we don't explain
here how this is done, but assume a `valid-user` function exists that
can tell us). If the user is valid we associate a new cookie called
"session" with the response. By starting with the `:response` value of
the request context, we ensure yada interprets our return value as a
Ring response rather than some other value.

We use Buddy's `sign` function to sign and encoded the cookie's value as
a JSON string. We only specify the credentials as `{:user user}` in this
case, but we could put much more into that map. The `sign` function
requires us to provide a secret symmetric key that we can use for both
signing and verification, but the library does allow us asymmetric key
options too.

The other method, GET, simply produces a form for user-agents that can
render HTML (browsers, typically) to post back. For reasons of cohesion,
it's a good idea to provide these two methods in the same resource to
encapsulate and dedupe the fields which are relevant to both the GET and
the POST.

[[authorization]]
=== Authorization

Authorization is the process of allowing a user access to a resource.
This may require knowledge about the user only (for example, in
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control[Role-based
access control]). Authorization may also depend on properties of the
resource identified by the HTTP request's URI (as part of an
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control[Attribute-based
access control] authorization scheme).

In either case, we assume that the user has already been authenticated,
and we are confident that their credentials are genuine.

In yada, authorization happens _after_ the resource's properties have
been loaded, because it may be necessary to check some aspect of the
resource itself as part of the authorization process.

By default, yada will use a declarative role-based authorization scheme.

[[default-authorization-scheme]]
==== Default authorization scheme

Any method can be protected by declaring a role or set of roles in its
model.

[source,clojure]
----
{:access-control
 {:authorization
  {:methods
   {:post :accounts/create-transaction}}}}
----

If multiple roles are involved, they can be composed inside vectors
using simple predicate logic.

[source,clojure]
----
{:access-control
 {:authorization
  {:methods
   {:post [:or [:and :accounts/user
                     :accounts/create-transaction]
               :superuser}}}}
----

Only the simple boolean 'operators' of `:and`, `:or` and `:not` are
allowed in this authorization scheme. This keeps the role definitions
declarative and easy to extract and process by other tooling.

Of course, authentication information is available in the request
context when a method is invoked, so any method may apply its own custom
authorization logic as necessary. However, yada encourages developers to
adopt a declarative approach to resources wherever possible, to maximise
the integration opportunities with other libraries and tools.

[[custom-authorization-scheme]]
==== Custom authorization scheme

A custom authorization scheme can be declared that will completely
replace the default authorization scheme already discussed.

First, decide on a keyword that will be used to dispatch your
authorization function. In this example, we've chosen
`:my/custom-authorization`.

Now declare the authorization function that will be called by yada
during request processing. This is a `defmethod`, as follows:

[source,clojure]
----
(defmethod yada.authorization/validate
  :my/custom-authorization
  [ctx credentials authorization]
…
)
----

The credentials argument contains all the verified credentials sent in
the request.

Now add an `:authorization` map to the `:access-control` part of your
resource model. The map must contain a `:scheme` value specific to your
resource model, along with any extra parameters you want to be passed as
the `authorization` argument to your authorization function. In this
example, we want to pass the `:my/ensure` parameter set to
`[:same-account]`. You can specify anything you like to be passed as
parameters (there are no schema restrictions here).

[source,clojure]
----
{:access-control
 {:authorization
  {:scheme :my/custom-authorization
   :my/ensure [:same-account]}}}
----

[[realms]]
=== Realms

yada supports multiple realms. By default, there is a single realm in
operation called "default". However, you can group authentication
schemes and authorization models in separate realms. Each realm can
contain multiple authentication schemes (it might be that a realm offers
a choice of how to authenticate).

[source,clojure]
----
{:access-control
  {:realms {"Gondor" {:authentication-schemes […]
                      :authorization {…}}
            "Mordor" {:authentication-schemes {…}
                      :authorization {…}}}}}
----

[[cross-origin-resource-sharing-cors]]
=== Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)

yada fully supports Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) allowing you to
provide APIs that are accessible from other origins.

For example, you may be creating an API that you wish other websites to
make use of, by allowing browsers visiting those websites access to your
API.

CORS is specified in the `:access-control` section of the
resource-model.

[source,clojure]
----
{:access-control
 {:allow-origin "*"
  :allow-credentials false
  :expose-headers #{"X-Custom"}
  :allow-methods #{:get :post}
  :allow-headers ["Api-Key"]
 }}
----

With the exception of `:allow-credentials` (which must be a boolean),
any of the values can be declared as single-arity functions, which are
called with the request-context as an argument to determine the value
for the corresponding response header.

[[http-strict-transport-security-hsts]]
=== HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

`clojure {:strict-transport-security {:max-age 12000}}`

Defaults to a maximum age of 31536000.

The HSTS header is only set if the scheme is HTTPS or the service is
behind a proxy (determined by the presence of the `X-Forwarded-For`
request header).

[[content-security-policy]]
=== Content Security Policy

[source,clojure]
----
{:content-security-policy "url-src"}
----

Defaults to `default-src https: data: 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'`.

[[clickjacking-prevention]]
=== Clickjacking prevention

A browser's iframe can be used for 'click-jacking'. By default yada
tells browsers not to allow this. The default value is `SAMEORIGIN`,
unless you override it in the resource-model.

[source,clojure]
----
{:x-frame-options "NONE"}
----

[[cross-site-scripting-xss-protection]]
=== Cross-site Scripting (XSS) protection

yada also sets the `X-Xss-Protection` response header to
`1; mode=block`. This can be overridden in the resource model.

[source,clojure]
----
{:x-content-type-options "0"}
----

[[media-type-sniffing-protection]]
=== Media-type sniffing protection

By default, yada sets the `X-Content-Type-Options` response header to
`nosniff`. This tells browsers not to try to attempt to determine the
content-type of the response body.

Since yada sets the `Content-Type` header according to HTTP standards,
there should never be a need for a browser to 'sniff' the response body
for this information, preventing an attack that might exploit some
vulnerability in this process.
