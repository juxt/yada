[[parameters]]
Parameters
----------

Web requests can contain parameters that can influence the response and
yada can capture these. This is especially useful when you are writing
APIs.

There are different types of parameters, which you can mix-and-match.

* Query parameters (part of the request URI's query-string)
* Path parameters (embedded in the request URI's path)
* Request headers
* Form data
* Request bodies
* Cookies

There are many benefits to declaring the parameters in the resource
model.

* yada will check they exist, and return 400 (Malformed Request) errors
on requests that don't provide the ones you need for your logic
* yada will coerce them to the types you want, so you can avoid writing
loads of type-conversion logic in your code
* yada and other tools can process your declarations independently of
your request-processing code, e.g. to generate API documentation

For example, let's imagine a URI to access the transactions of a
fictitious bank account.

[source,nohighlight]
----
https://bigbank.com/accounts/1234/transactions?since=tuesday
----

There could be 2 parameters here. The first, `1234`, is contained in the
path `/accounts/1234/transactions`. We call this a **path parameter**.

The second, `tuesday`, is embedded in the URI's query-string (after the
`?` symbol). We call this a **query parameter**.

You can declare these parameters in the **resource model**.

[source,clojure]
----
{:parameters {:path {:entry Long}}
 :methods {:get {:parameters {:query {:since String}}}
           :post {:parameters {:body …}}}
----

Parameters can be specified at _resource-level_ or at __method-level__.
Path parameters are usually declared at the resource-level because they
form part of the URI that is independent of the request's method. In
contrast, query parameters usually apply to GET requests, so it's common
to define this parameter at the __method-level__, and it's only visible
if the method we declare it with matches the request method.

We declare parameter values using the syntax of
https://prismatic.com[Prismatic]'s
https://github.com/prismatic/schema[schema] library. This allows us to
get quite sophisticated in how we define parameters.

[source,clojure]
----
(require [schema.core :refer (defschema)]

(defschema Transaction
  {:payee String
   :description String
   :amount Double}

{:parameters {:path {:entry Long}}
 :methods {:get {:parameters {:query {:since String}}}
           :post {:parameters {:body Transaction}}}

[[capturing-multi-value-parameters]]
Capturing multi-value parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Occasionally, you may have multiple values associated with a given
parameter. Query strings and HTML form data both allow for the same
parameter to be specified multiple times.

....
/search?accno=1234&accno=1235
....

To capture all values in a vector, declare your parameter type as a
vector type:

[source,clojure]
----
{:parameters {:query {:accno [Long]}}}}
----

[[capturing-large-request-bodies]]
Capturing large request bodies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes, request bodies are very large or even unlimited. To ensure
you don't run out of memory receiving this request data, you can specify
more suitable containers, such as files, database blobs, Amazon S3
buckets or your own extensions.

All data produced and received from yada is handled efficiently and
asynchronously, ensuring that even with very large data streams your
service continues to work.
