== Getting Started

In this quick tutorial we're going to run a real Clojure project, diving into the code to show how [yada]#yada# is used.

Our project is called 'Edge', a sample project from JUXT to show some of our libraries in action. It link:https://github.com/juxt/edge[lives on GitHub].

We'll clone it first, then build it, then run it, then browse the examples and even make modifications.

So let's get going!

=== Clone

First let's clone the project and change into its working directory.

[source]
----
git clone https://github.com/juxt/edge
cd edge
----

=== Build & Run

Next we build and run it, in _development_ mode.

[source]
----
boot dev
----

This can take up to a couple of minutes to build and run from scratch so don't worry if you have to wait a bit before you see anything.

[source]
----
Starting reload server on ws://localhost:43201
Writing boot_reload.cljs...
Writing boot_cljs_repl.cljs...
09:13:50.368 [clojure-agent-send-off-pool-0] INFO  edge.server - Started web-server on port 3000

Starting file watcher (CTRL-C to quit)...

Compiling {sass}... 3 changed files.
----

=== Browse

Fire up a browser and browse to http://localhost:3000/hello. You should see a simple `Hello World` message.

=== Connect a REPL

Let's connect a REPL.

Start a new terminal and change into the project's working directory again.

[source]
----
cd edge
----

If the project is still building, wait until you see the following line before trying to connect.

----
nREPL server started on port 5600 on host 127.0.0.1 - nrepl://127.0.0.1:5600
----

Connect a client REPL to this JVM like this:

[source]
----
boot repl
----

This should result in something similar to this:

[source]
----
REPL-y 0.3.7, nREPL 0.2.12
Clojure 1.8.0
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 1.8.0_92-b14
        Exit: Control+D or (exit) or (quit)
    Commands: (user/help)
        Docs: (doc function-name-here)
              (find-doc "part-of-name-here")
Find by Name: (find-name "part-of-name-here")
      Source: (source function-name-here)
     Javadoc: (javadoc java-object-or-class-here)
    Examples from clojuredocs.org: [clojuredocs or cdoc]
              (user/clojuredocs name-here)
              (user/clojuredocs "ns-here" "name-here")
user=>
----

We're going to start changing some of Edge's source code soon, and when we do that we'll type `(reset)` on our REPL. So let's try that now.

[source]
----
user=> (reset)
:reloading (edge.web edge.api edge.server edge.system user)
:resumed
user=>
----

=== Test the service

Let's send an HTTP request to the system to check it is working. We can use a browser to visit http://localhost:3000/hello or use `curl` if you have it installed on your system:

[source,curl]
----
$ curl http://localhost:3000/hello
----

The result should be the same:

[source,curl]
----
Hello World!
----

=== Locate the source code

Fire up an editor and load up the file `src/edge/hello.clj`.

Locate the function called `hello-routes`. This returns a simple route structure that matches on the URI paths of incoming HTTP requests.

[source]
----
(defn hello-routes [_]
  ["/hello" (yada/handler "Hello World!\n")])
----

Make a change to string `"Hello World!"`, for example, change it to `"Hello Wonderful World!"`.


=== Reset the system

Now we've made a change to Edge's source code, we must tell the system to reset. The system will then detect all the code changes and necessary dependencies to reload.

[source]
----
user=> (reset)
:reloading (edge.web edge.api edge.server edge.system user)
:resumed
user=>
----

Let's test the service again:

[source,curl]
----
$ curl http://localhost:3000/hello
----

You should now see that the change has been made:

[source]
----
Hello Wonderful World!
----

Congratulations. You're all up and running with a project built with [yada]#yada#. This will make a great lab to try out your own [yada]#yada# experiments and see what is possible.

Browse to http://localhost:3000 and have fun!
