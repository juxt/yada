[[the-request-context]]
== The Request Context

When given the HTTP **request**, the handler first creates a
*request-context* and populates it with various values, such as the
request and the *resource-model* that corresponds to the request's URI.

The handler then threads the *request-context* through a chain of
functions, called the **interceptor-chain**. This 'chain' is just a list
of functions specified in the *resource-model* that has been carefully
crafted to generate a response that complies fully with HTTP standards.
However, as with anything in the resource-model, you can choose to
modify it to your exact requirements if necessary.

The functions making up the interceptor-chain are not necessarily
executed in a single thread but rather an asynchronous event-driven
implementation enabled by a third-party library called manifold.


=== path-for

Rather than hardcode URLs, you can create the correctly URL with yada's `path-for` function.
